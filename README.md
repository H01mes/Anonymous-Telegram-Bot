# Anonymous Telegram Bot
This project is an Telegram bot. The bot itself acts as a secure wall between other users and yourself, making you anonymous while providing text replies to the other users. The idea behind this bot is for people who own public channels and don't want to expose their private profiles to everybody.

It has been developed using [*Python Telegram Bot*](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) v6.0.0

# How to set it up
1. First you will need a bot token, which you can obtain from the [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Make sure you have installed the [*Python Telegram Bot*](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library (v6.0.0).
3. Download this project and edit the file config.txt
   * Add your bot token
   * Add the system path to the files
   * Add your telegram user ID. It is a unique identifier that can be found in your profile
4. Launch AnonymousForwardBot.py
5. Start your bot by sending a /start command in Telegram
